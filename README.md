In order to make it work you need to build https://github.com/CreativeMD/vlcj + https://github.com/CreativeMD/vlcj-natives yourself.

Steps
* Clone these two repositories to your computer
* Add them to your eclipse (or any other development software) workspace
* In Eclipse right click project -> Run As -> Maven install
* If it compiles successfully you are done!
